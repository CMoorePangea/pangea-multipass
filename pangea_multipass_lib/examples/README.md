# Trying Pangea Multipass

Pangea Multipass is a general purpose library for checking a user's access to resources in an upstream system. While we (Pangea) originally built this for our AI/LLM apps, you can use this library independently. To see that in action, check out the `simple` folder, otherwise explore your framework of choice.


Each directory has its own README to get setup though many of the steps overlap.
